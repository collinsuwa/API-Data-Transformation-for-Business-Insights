## 🚀 Excited to share the outcomes of my latest Data Analysis endeavor post completing the dbt Fundamental dbt Labs Short Course!

I recently spearheaded a project aimed at constructing a streamlined Business Intelligence solution for Northwind Traders. Leveraging the power of dbt (Data Build Tools) core, alongside PostgreSQL, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Power BI, i transformed raw data into actionable insights.



Let's dive into the process:



# 📊 Data Extraction: Efficiently sourced data via APIs.

# 🔧 Pipelines: Developed robust pipelines for seamless data flow.

# 💾 Data Warehousing: Stored and organized data in a PostgreSQL Data Warehouse.

# 🌱 dbt Seeds: Applied dbt seeds for data initialization.

# 🔍 Modeling in dbt: Utilized select statements for effective data modeling.

# 📈 Visualization: Crafted dynamic dashboards using Power BI and Microsoft PowerPoint.


Thrilled to have successfully integrated these tools and techniques to drive meaningful insights for Northwind Traders.
